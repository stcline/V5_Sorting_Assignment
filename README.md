Python Portfolio Problem 5 - Automated Sorting System

Design and implement an automated sorting system using the VEX V5 platform to address a real-world challenge in waste management or recycling. This project will integrate elements from previous problems while introducing new complexities and real-world applications.

## Project Overview

Create a system that can identify, sort, and properly dispose of different types of objects based on their characteristics. This system should utilize multiple sensors, actuators, and custom-designed components to effectively handle various items.

## Requirements

1. Use at least two different types of sensors to identify object characteristics (e.g., color, size, material).
2. Implement at up to two smart motors (if you need additional actuators, use the legacy motors and servos) for object manipulation and sorting.
3. Utilize the VEX V5 brain screen to display real-time sorting information and system status.
4. Write a Python script that integrates all components and implements the sorting logic.
5. OPTIONAL: Design and 3D print at least one custom component to enhance the sorting mechanism (stl file must be provided by 2/18).

## Suggested Implementation

### Sensor Integration
- Use an analog sensor to identify object types (e.g., plastic, metal, paper).
- Implement a distance sensor to detect object presence and size.
- Consider digital sensors to detect objects and other characteristics like weight.

### Actuator Control
- Use actuators to control a conveyor belt system for object transportation.
- Implement a servo-controlled arm for precise object placement in sorting bins.

### VEX V5 Brain Display
- Show real-time sorting statistics (e.g., items sorted by type).
- Display system status and any error messages.

### Custom 3D Printed Component - OPTIONAL
- Design a specialized gripper attachment for the sorting arm to handle various object shapes.

### Python Script
- Implement sensor reading and data processing.
- Control actuators based on sensor input.
- Manage the sorting logic and decision-making process.
- Update the brain display with relevant information.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Functionality: How effectively does the system sort objects?
2. Sensor Utilization: Creative and effective use of multiple sensors.
3. Actuator Control: Smooth and precise control of motors and servo.
4. Code Quality: Well-structured, commented Python code.
5. Custom Component: Innovative design and practical application of the 3D printed part.
6. Real-world Applicability: How well does the solution address actual sorting challenges?
